### 3. **Pelvis & Hip Stability**
- ✅ Hip level alignment (critical for Tadasana)
- ✅ Pelvic square positioning
- ✅ Core engagement indicators

### 4. **Spine & Torso Elongation**
- ✅ Shoulder-over-hip alignment
- ✅ Spinal elongation detection
- ✅ Posture correction (forward/backward lean)
- ✅ Torso compression detection

### 5. **Shoulder Positioning**
- ✅ Shoulder level alignment
- ✅ Shoulder broadening (anti-hunching)
- ✅ Tension release indicators

### 6. **Natural Arm Positioning**
- ✅ Natural arm hang detection
- ✅ Elbow relaxation
- ✅ Wrist positioning by sides

### 7. **Head & Neck Alignment**

## 🎨 Visual Feedback Enhancements

### Color-Coded Keypoints
- 🔴 **Red (Pulsing)**: Critical alignment issues requiring immediate attention
- 🟡 **Amber**: Minor adjustments needed
- 🟢 **Green (Glowing)**: Perfect alignment achieved
- ⚪ **White**: High confidence detection
- 🔵 **Blue**: Standard detection

### Enhanced Skeleton Rendering
- Thicker lines for better visibility
- Pulsing effects for critical errors
- Glow effects for perfect alignment
- Special highlighting for spine and leg connections
- Keypoint labels for critical Tadasana points

## 📊 Intelligent Scoring System

### Weighted Scoring
- **Critical Errors (-20 points)**: Weight distribution, hip leveling, major posture issues
- **Major Errors (-15 points)**: Leg engagement, significant alignment problems
- **Minor Adjustments (-5 to -8 points)**: Fine-tuning corrections

### Encouraging Feedback
- **100% Perfect**: "Perfect Tadasana! Feel the strength and stability. Breathe deeply."
- **85%+ Excellent**: "Excellent foundation! Minor adjustments will perfect your Mountain Pose."
- **70%+ Good**: "Good alignment! Focus on the key adjustments below."

## 🎯 Real-Time Corrections

### Detailed Anatomical Guidance
- Specific muscle engagement cues
- Precise positioning instructions
- Breathing reminders for perfect poses
- Progressive difficulty awareness

### Examples of Real-Time Feedback
- "Left leg: engage thigh muscles, straighten knee (168°)"
- "Hips: level your pelvis, engage core muscles"
- "Crown: reach up through top of head, lengthen neck"
- "Shoulders: broaden across chest, roll shoulders back"
